# Description
We are using Sphero to teach programming fundamentals (for loops, functions, variables, etc.) in a hands on way. We are 
incorporating basketball as a familiar medium to provide context to programming. The students will navagate the Sphero through the basketball-themed obstacle course only using programming scripts to move the Sphero.
