# Title
Using Sphero to teach programming fundementals 

# Description
We are using Sphero to teach programming fundamentals (for loops, functions, variables, etc.) in a hands on way. We are 
incorporating basketball as a familiar medium to provide context to programming. The students will navagate the Sphero through the basketball-themed obstacle course only using programming scripts to move the Sphero. TAP is the technology ambassadors program that allows students to learn leadership skills and help promote IT and STEM careers.

# Installation/setup
* A Sphero
* A device (laptop/tablet/phone) with bluetooth connectivity  
* An obstacle course

# Usage
* Connect the Sphero robot via bluetooth with the device in order to move it. 
* Using the Sphero edu coding enviorment, build a program with block code.
* execute the program to see the Sphero move.
